# densitycontour

`densitycontour` -- draw density contours from sample points.


## USAGE

`densitycontour` is a Python module that helps with creating contour plots from
a sample of points.  It is useful for visualizing the output of Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

Typical usage is like follows:

```python
import pylab	# Import matplotlib environment.
import densitycontour

# Create scatter-data and rasterized image objects.
# x_array and y_array are "raw" inputs.
sample_data = densitycontour.ScatterData(x_array, y_array)

# Create a raster array for plotting, using default binning.
raster = sample_data.rasterize()

# Use the ZoomedContourVisualizer post-processor on the raster array.
contours = densitycontour.ZoomedContourVisualizer(raster, mode="nearest")

# Plot the contours for confidence levels 50% and 90% respectively,
# using default settings.
contours.plot((0.5, 0.9))

# Show the figure.
pylab.show()
```

The resulting figure should look like the image showed in one of the
following panels:

![Test output of densitycontour](densitycontour-test.png?raw=true "Test output of densitycontour")

You can run the module as a Python script to see the test diagrams.
